# Project2
Here's what you have to do starting from a project with an application.
add a new model called a user and this model should have these fields.
A first name field for the user class named character field for the user and then an email field
script that will populate your database with fake users then confirm that the populating worked through
This slash user's page will bring him a list of the user names and emails which means if someone goes
to your main web page that index page they'll just see some heading whatever you want to show.
But when they go to the expense and slash users they'll actually see NHT analysis of the usernames and
emails and then you're going to be using template tags actually generate this content from the user
model.
And remember to change your or else PI file to actually deal the changes to the user's extension both
in your actual application
